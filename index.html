    <h1 class="title">Places to Hangout in Boston</h1> <!-- Heading-->
    <p>Hello everyone. Welcome to my blog webpage!
    </p>

    <p> Are you new to Boston? Trying to find some nice hangout places? <br> If so, I got you covered!
        I will include three of my favorite places to hangout in Boston and how to get there. <br> Let's get into it!
    </p>

    <h2>Boston Common</h2>

    <p> Did you know Boston Boston Common is the oldest park in the U.S. Whether it is the summer or winter <br>
        there is always
        something to do. You can find fairs/festivals in the common park. You can even watch free theater <br> someday
        if you're lucky. You can ride on a swan boat in Boston Common pond. I always go there with my friends <br>
        because it is a nice and quiet place and you can smell the freshness in the air. During winter, you can skate in
        the <br> frog pond and explore different clothing stores right next to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Public Commuting options:</h2>
    <p> If you are in Boston already, you can take the red line or the green line based on your current <br>
        location and get off at Park Street station.

    <h2>Charles River Esplanade</h2>
    <img class="shadow" src="Images/Charles_riv.jpeg" alt="Charles River bank">

    <p> The bank of Charles River which is 17 miles stretch of land is one of the most beautiful places in the <br>
        Boston. Whether you want to go for a walk or bike in the evening this is the place <br>
        you want to go. You can also kayak in summer. They also added a new playground for the <br>
        kids. This place is the perfect sunset spot. So, next time you are in Boston and want to watch <br>
        the sunset, now you know where to go!

        Boston Harbor is the place to go. They have 40 miles of pedestrian- and bike-friendly public <br>
        access at the water edge. They also have boat rides by which you can get to some of the <br>

        to spend time with family and friends.
